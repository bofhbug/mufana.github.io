# PowerShell (Under The Wire)

Recently I stumbled upon a 'somewhat' hidden germ. The 'Under the Wire' wargames. 
If you want to learn PowerShell or boost your PowerShell skills, definitely to <http://www.underthewire.tech/wargames.htm>.
_Under the Wire_ contains a few cool PowerShell games. A typical game has 15 different levels and are more challenging as you level up.

A great way to learn PowerShell or acquire new skills.
