# Up Next

I've got some great posts lined up for the next month.

### Jenkins

I've been using Jenkins for a while now. And it's just very cool. So, I can't help myself doing another post about Jenkins.

### TeamCity

Why? Because we can! And since I'm spending lots of time with Jenkins, I wanted to compare Jenkins with TeamCity.

### PowerShell on Linux

I'm a Linux guy. So, I just had to try this for myself. PowerShell on RedHat.

### Work related projects

Something about creating eMail addresses and HomeFolders. Automatically that is!

### Docker

Just installed Docker and I love it. Still in the 'learning' mode. So you have to be a little patient.

### Something about Dev/Ops

Since I'm using Jenkins / TeamCity / Pester and more Dev/Ops tools, I deciced it is time to do a blog about Dev/Ops.
