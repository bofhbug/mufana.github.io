# Up Next

Lot's of cool new things.

## Jenkins

I've been using Jenkins for a while now. And it's just very cool. So, I can't help myself doing another post about Jenkins.

## TeamCity

Why? Because we can!

## PowerShell on Linux

I'm a Linux guy. So, I just had to try this for myself. PowerShell on RedHat.

## Work related projects

Something about creating eMail addresses.

## Docker

Yep! Docker baby!

## Something about Dev/Ops

Since I'm using Jenkins / TeamCity / Pester and more Dev/Ops tools, I deciced it is time to do a blog about it.
