# 24 - The name is...

We all know 'Spectre' as the latest James Bond movie. The 24th installment of the series. In the movie and books SPECTRE is led by the evil villain [Ernst Stavro Blofeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld).

Lately 'Spectre' became known as a critical vulnerabillity in modern processors. A Hardware bug that allow programs to steal data. This might include your password, eMails or any document on your computer. Deary me! That's awfull!

## Ice Age

And if that's not enough, there's more bad news to cope with. Prepare for: __MELTDOWN__

Meltdown is probably known (amongst 5-12 year olds) as the sequal to the original Ice Age movie. In this movie, Sid, Manny and Diego have to escape an upcoming flood. Terrible! 

Recently 'Meltdown' became known as another critical vulnerabillity in modern processors.

Both 'Meltdown' and 'Spectre' work in different ways.

__Meltdown__ 

 Applies to Intel only and allows malicious programs to allow kernel memory access from te user space.

 __Spectre__

 Intel, ARM and AMD processors. Grants access to 'sensitive' information in applications memory by tricking the processor to execute code which normally isn't allowed.

## The world will never be the same again

As we lost our innocence today!

## Our beautiful broken digital mind

Needs to be repaired. __A.S.A.P__

But, you might want to find out if your mind is actually broken. To do that; we will use a little PowerShell.

1. Open a new PowerSell Console as _Administrator_.

2. On the console type: ```Install-Module speculationcontrol```

This will install a PowerShell module created by Microsoft to help you check whether your system(s) are affected.

3. If you get a ```untrusted repository``` dialog, press ```yes```.

4. When the module is installed type: ```Get-SpeculationControlSettings```.

If anything shows up ```RED``` it means, you're computer is not protected. (Mine is not protected!)

## Now:
