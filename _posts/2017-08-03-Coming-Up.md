# Coming Up

I've got some great blogs lined-up to be posted here.

* PowerShell and Slack

Been using this one for quite some time to send push notifications to my phone. 

## Work related projects

These days my work requires me to do a lot of PowerShell coding and do some 'for me' pretty complex stuff. Those tasks include:

* Creating homefolders and set the owner rights on a folder

* Create eMail addresses for new users

Blog is in the making!

## And last but not least!

* SQL HTML Reports with PowerShell  

Until a few weeks ago I had a script that sended out a SQL job report. Just a basic mail. Nothing fancy. Recently I changed this to a nice HTML formatted eMail.
