# Get a random help_about file

One way to learn PowerShell is to read the help files. They give you great insight how a certain functionality works.

I've created a very simple function for this purpose that's placed in my PowerShell profile. So, everytime I fire-up the Console, I can start reading a help 
file by simlpy typing: ```Get-About```. 

## The function

* Step 1

Create a variable called: ```$table```. The value of this variable is an array. ```@()``` that gets the content of: ```Get-Help about*```.

* Step 2

Add another variable called: ```$random```. The value of this variable is: ```(get-random -Inputobject $table).name```

* Step 3

Actually get a random help by typing: ```get-help $random```.

Turn all this code into a simple function:

```powershell
Function Get-About {    
  $table = @(get-help about*)    
  $random = (get-random -InputObject $table).name    
  Get-help $random
}
```

And you're done!
